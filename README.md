Stephen Grider's manager tutorial
<br>
Notes:
<br>
For this project, I used React Navigation, not React Native Redux Flux. 
<br>
Biggest challenges:
<br>
Because the tutorial uses RNRF, I had to do a lot of researchc on how to make navigation work with redux. This was the biggest challenge. Minor challenges had to do with Firebase, which again, was related to the fact that this app uses React Navigation instead of RNRF. It was very difficult learning how to set parameters to the routes and produce the results as desired. After lots of reading on stackoverflow, github, and udemy, I was able to troubleshoot most problems. It also didn't hurt that I was just lucky (especially towards the end). Just lots of test and trial. 
<br>
Good luck!
